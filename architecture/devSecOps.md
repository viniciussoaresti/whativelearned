## DevSecOps:

Comes to add to the security culture, and uniting DevOps with that, and provides methods for identifying security vulnerabilities (pre and post release) and why did they happen, and also for correcting them.

The development and release flow of DevOps is remodeled to:

- Plan:
Development and Operations teams, includes threat modeling;

- Code:
Development team, includes Static Source Code Analysis (SAST), Software Code Analysis and Open Source Software Governance;

- Build:
Development team, includes SAST and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST);

- Test:
Development team, includes Penetration Testing and Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST);

- Release:
Development and Operations teams, includes Compliance Validation;

- Deploy:
Operations team, includes Threat Intelligence;

- Operate:
Operations team, includes Red Team, SAST, DAST and IAST;

- Monitor:
Development and Operations teams, includes Crowdsourced Security Program;

### Why:

Cloud Security Top 10:

- 1: Insecure Use of Developer Credentials:
Like a password stored on github.

- 2: Publicly Accessible Storage:
Data that should not be public.

- 3: Improper Use of Default Configurations:
Can introduce risk;

- 4: Broken Access Control:
Least privilege principles not followed.

- 5: Misconfigured Network Construct:
Not using methods do control network access beyond simple IP address-based rules.

- 6: Inadequate Monitoring and Logging:


- 7: Lack of Inventory Management:


- 8: Domain Hijacking:


- 9: Lack of a Disaster Recovery Plan:


- 10: Manual Account Configuration:
