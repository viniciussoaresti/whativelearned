## Privacy by Design:

First of all, since around 2016, a lot of discussions about personal data privacy are taking place in the world, producing, as a result, privacy laws, such as GDPR (EU), CCPA (California) and LGPD (Brazil).

There's been a lot of system attacks, including ransomware cases, and they're even worse in this pandemic context we're living (2020-2021). So there's even more focus to this topic than it already had, specially when we're talking about designing new components and systems. So we should, by design (not only on our implementation), protect the user's privacy.
