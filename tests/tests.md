# Tests:

Tests in software development are pretty important, allowing teams to develop new functionalities, and test, for example, if it's not breaking somewhere else in the codebase.

## Concepts:

- Black Box:

"Black-box testing is a method of software testing that examines the functionality of an application without peering into its internal structures or workings. This method of test can be applied virtually to every level of software testing: unit, integration, system and acceptance. It is sometimes referred to as specification-based testing", [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-box_testing).

- White Box:

"White-box is a method of software testing that tests internal structures or workings of an application, as opposed to its functionality (i.e. black-box testing). In white-box testing an internal perspective of the system, as well as programming skills, are used to design test cases. The tester chooses inputs to exercise paths through the code and determine the expected outputs. This is analogous to testing nodes in a circuit, e.g. in-circuit testing (ICT). White-box testing can be applied at the unit, integration and system levels of the software testing process. Although traditional testers tended to think of white-box testing as being done at the unit level, it is used for integration and system testing more frequently today. It can test paths within a unit, paths between units during integration, and between subsystems during a systemâ€“level test.", [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-box_testing).

## Test Types:

### Automatized:

- Unit tests:

"Unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code", [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing).

In OOP, thus being the object methods, and on functional programming, functions, for example.

- Integrated tests:

"Integration testing is the phase in software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group", [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing).

- Functional tests:

"Functional testing bases its test cases on the specifications of the software component under test. Functions are tested by feeding them input and examining the output", [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_testing).
