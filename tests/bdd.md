# BDD

"Behavior-driven development (BDD) is an agile software development process that encourages collaboration among developers, QA, and non-technical or business participants in a software project. It encourages teams to use conversation and concrete examples to formalize a shared understanding of how the application should behave", [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development).

Documentation, tests and examples are the base to BDD.

There are many advantages to BDD, like knowledge sharing, dynamic documentation, better software vision and more.
