# Aws:
## Introduction
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a suite of components that simplify management and deployment of code.
There are a LOT of different components, each with its own documentation and specificity of use cases.
Starting my first work, on 23/12/19, I was asked to study a bunch of them: SAM, Lambda, DynamoDB and API-Gateway.

## AWS SAM:
"It's an open-source framework that you can use to build serverless applications on AWS."
Basically, it's Maven, but adapted for AWS.
Docs:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html

## AWS Lambda:
Basically, it's a service where you put code, that only runs when certain events occur. That provides its users with cheaper prices when launching and maintaining a web app.

## AWS Api-Gateway:
Basically, from what i've understood until now, it's a service for creating, maintaining and consuming
API's and other AWS services.
Docs:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html

## Amazon DynamoDB:
It's a nosql DB that's fast. And that's about it.
