# Js:
The client-sided loved language.

JS's a multi-paradigm language, and as such, has the ability to be coded on object-oriented programming, functional programming, and so on.

## Tips:

- Conditional Operator:
Basically, a very nice way to summarize short if-else expressions.
```javascript
condition ? value-if-true : value-if-false;
//Example
let a = 1;
a === 1 ? console.log('equals 1') : console.log('different');
```
- Array reverse method:
Didn't know about this function.
```javascript
array.reverse();
//Example
let a = [1,2,3];
console.log(a.reverse()); //result == [3, 2, 1]
```
