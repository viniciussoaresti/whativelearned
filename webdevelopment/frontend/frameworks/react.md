# React:

Open-source front-end javascript library, developed initially by Facebook, with focus on dynamic components.

## Starting

There's two easy ways to create a new React application. [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) (template) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (framework).

When you install node, it comes with npx, the package executor, so you can simply use:

```npx create-react-app podcastr```

And then, for starting your app:

```yarn start```
