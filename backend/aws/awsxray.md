# AWS XRay
## Introduction:
X-Ray provides an end-to-end view of requests as they travel through your application, and
shows a map of your applicationâ€™s underlying components. You can use X-Ray to analyze
both applications in development and in production, from simple three-tier applications to
complex microservices applications consisting of thousands of services. Works like a log but
with all the details.
