# Queue
Data scructure on which only one element can be manipulated at a time.

Has both queue and dequeue methods (insert and delete), that realizes the operation based on the following implementation:

- FIFO:
First In, First Out.

You could say that it's on an inverted order (from the bottom to the top items).

The deleted element using pop method, for that reason, is the first one inserted.
