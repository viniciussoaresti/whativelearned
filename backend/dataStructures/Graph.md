# Graph
Data scructure on which it's possible to define the relationship between elements, for example, an item (A) can relate only to another item (B), and the latter (B) is able to relate to 10 (or less/more) previously defined elements.

- The relationships are called edges (links/lines), and the elements are often called vertices, nodes or points.
