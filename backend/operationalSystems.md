In simpler terms, we can say that an OS is an interface between the user and the machine", [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-an-os-operating-system-definition-for-beginners/).

### Kernel:

"The kernel is so named because—like a seed inside a hard shell—it exists within the OS and controls all the major functions of the hardware, whether it’s a phone, laptop, server, or any other kind of computer", [RedHat](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/what-is-the-linux-kernel).
