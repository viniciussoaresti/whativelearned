# Webpack:

"At its core, webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph from one or more entry points and then combines every module your project needs into one or more bundles, which are static assets to serve your content from", [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/).

"Create React App (CRA) ships with webpack already under the hood, but usually, we would need to add more configurations as our app grows. Luckily for us, we can create a webpack.config.js file and put our webpack configurations in there", [Logrocket](https://blog.logrocket.com/versatile-webpack-configurations-react-application/).

### Entry and Output:

"An entry point indicates which module webpack should use to begin building out its internal dependency graph. Webpack will figure out which other modules and libraries that entry point depends on (directly and indirectly)."
