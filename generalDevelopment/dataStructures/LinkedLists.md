# Linked Lists
That type of list consists of nodes, in which each one contains the data, and an indication of the next value.

- Simple:
The nodes contain only the next item reference.

- Doubly:
The nodes contain both the previous and next item references.

- Circular:
The first node contains the last item as the previous item reference, and the last one has the first node as the next.
