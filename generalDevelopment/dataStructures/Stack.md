# Stacks
Data scructure on which only one element can be manipulated at a time.

Has both push and pop methods (insert and delete), that realizes the operation based on the following implementation:

- LIFO: 
Last In, First Out.

You could say that it's on a regular order (from the top to the bottom items).

The deleted element using pop method, for that reason, is the last one inserted.
