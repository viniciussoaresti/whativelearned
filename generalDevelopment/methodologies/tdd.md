# TDD

"Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases", [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).

There are many advantages to TDD, like knowledge sharing, dynamic documentation, better software vision, productivity and more.
