# Objected-Oriented Programming

The goal for OOP is having a good abstraction level, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. It aims to be as close as possible to the what we would put as being the business rules, with classes and objects representing real-world concepts.

## 1. Concepts:

### 1.1. Abstraction:

"Abstraction is one of the key concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. Its main goal is to handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user. That enables the user to implement more complex logic on top of the provided abstraction without understanding or even thinking about all the hidden complexity", [Stackify](https://stackify.com/oop-concept-abstraction/).

### 1.2. Encapsulation:

"By definition, encapsulation describes the idea of bundling data and methods that work on that data within one unit, like a class in Java. This concept is also often used to hide the internal representation, or state of an object from the outside. This is called information hiding", [Stackify](https://stackify.com/oop-concept-for-beginners-what-is-encapsulation/).

### 1.3. Inheritance:

"Inheritance is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. It is a mechanism where you can to derive a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods. You can use it to declare different kinds of exceptions, add custom logic to existing frameworks, and even map your domain model to a database", [Stackify](https://stackify.com/oop-concept-inheritance/).

### 1.4. Polymorphism:

"Polymorphism is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) and describes situations in which something occurs in several different forms. In computer science, it describes the concept that you can access objects of different types through the same interface. Each type can provide its own independent implementation of this interface", [Stackify](https://stackify.com/oop-concept-inheritance/).

#### 1.4.1. Overload or Early Binding:

"Overloading a method simply means two or more methods have the same method name with different arguments or parameters(compulsory) and return type(not necessary)", [Medium](https://medium.com/@atandaoluchiaminat/overload-vs-override-in-object-oriented-programming-oop-a38ca0ccaf40).

#### 1.4.2. Override or Late Binding:

"Overriding a method simply means that a subclass redefines its inherited method(s) when it needs to change or extend the behavior of that method", [Medium](https://medium.com/@atandaoluchiaminat/overload-vs-override-in-object-oriented-programming-oop-a38ca0ccaf40).
